Macro 10000
Coarse 100
Precise 1

Problem Floats are -1 to 1 in increments of 1/127. 0.1 doesn't exist. 

Precise 1 is -127/127 to 127/127
Coarse changes to +-127
127*127 = +-16,129

receivers should track the animated locale. 

X 0.25 is positive 0.75 is negative 
Move_aim_Z y aim, x rotates y offset receivers
Move_aim_Y z aim, x rotates y offset receivers
Move_aim_X z aim, y rotates z offset receivers

Need to add rotation structure
need to add local and remote parent constraints for ___WorldSyncResetTarget and precise_z
